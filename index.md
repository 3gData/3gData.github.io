## Procedural Generation System.
This system uses a combination of Fractal Brownian Motion and other algorithms to create different terrain based on Biomes.\
Biomes are generated using a combination of temperature and voronoi diagrams / worley noise.

# Previous Work

## Sound-Responsive Zombies.
A fun little project in which i worked on, These zombies listen out for sounds played and also have sight. Pretty cool right? Created with almost no assets and within a day.

An ice skill from the anime "BNHA" from the character "Todoroki". The user shoots spikes from their character, inflicting a stun+damage on the enemy.\
**The only asset in this video is my programming. All other assets are owned by other partys.**

Just as it sounds! A bridge that builds itself.\
All Lighting and building and Scripting is done by me.
