## Experience
I have been a developer on Roblox for 3 years now. With lots of experience working back and front end Programming, i am comftorably adapted to LUA and the Roblox API.

# Notable Creations
## Fully Customisable Weather System.
This system has many types of weather, all mixable depending on settings. For example, It can just be "Sunny". But it can also be "Fog-Rain" or "Lightning-HeavyRain". There are multiple different types of weather combinations, all selected based on Random Chance at randomised preset intervals.
 
# Previous Work
