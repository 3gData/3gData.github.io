An ice skill from the anime "BNHA" from the character "Todoroki". The user shoots spikes from their character, inflicting a stun+damage on the enemy.\
**The only asset in this video is my programming. All other assets are owned by other partys.**

# Self-Building-Bridge
Just as it sounds! A bridge that builds itself.\
All Lighting and building and Scripting is done by me.
